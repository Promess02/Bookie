## Bookie is an app where you can search for books and save them to your to-read list. 
You can also write notes for each book and give it a rating. The app is able to track when you started reading a book and when you finished it.
Each read book is saved to your stats screen. User interface is entirely built using Jetpack Compose. The app uses Firebase for user authentication and data storage.
Google's book api provides the external data necessary to find books with a given query.
To make this project possible I used Clean Architecure, Hilt & Dagger, viewmodels, navigation, Retrofit.
